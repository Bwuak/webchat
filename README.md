A web chat application using Elixir and Phoenix.

Evolved from a single chatroom page served by a controller to a multi-server multi-chatrooms application served by LiveView.</br>
The /chat page is handled with Phoenix.LiveView, everything else by controllers.</br>
Messages are exchanged via channels.</br>
